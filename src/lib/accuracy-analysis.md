## üö® **Critical Missing Components for Real-World Accuracy**

### 1. **External Data Integration**
```javascript
// Missing: Market data, economic indicators
const externalFactors = {
  marketGrowth: 0.15,        // Industry growth rate
  economicIndex: 0.95,       // Economic health indicator
  competitivePressure: 0.3,  // Market competition level
  seasonality: [1.2, 0.8, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 1.3, 1.1, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4]
};
```

### 2. **Advanced ML Models**
```javascript
// Current: Simple linear regression
// Needed: 
- ARIMA models for time series
- Random Forest for non-linear relationships
- LSTM neural networks for complex patterns
- Ensemble methods combining multiple models
```

### 3. **Uncertainty Quantification**
```javascript
// Missing: Confidence intervals, scenario analysis
const prediction = {
  base: 100000,
  optimistic: 120000,  // +20% scenario
  pessimistic: 80000,  // -20% scenario
  confidence: 0.75     // 75% confidence interval
};
```

### 4. **Validation Framework**
```javascript
// Missing: Backtesting, cross-validation
const validation = {
  trainTestSplit: 0.8,      // 80% training, 20% testing
  crossValidation: 5,        // 5-fold cross-validation
  outOfSampleTesting: true,  // Test on unseen data
  accuracyMetrics: ['MAPE', 'RMSE', 'MAE']
};
```
